Rotate6SidedSkybox.shader is a Shader that rotates the Skybox.
It is suitable for reproducing the sky like the real world, such as rotating the starry sky and the sun, with Skybox.
As shown in the image, X-axis rotation, Y-axis rotation and Z-axis rotation are possible.
It can also be rotated by a combination of X & Y axis rotation and X & Y & Z axis rotation.
You can also specify the rotation speed, rotation angle in the initial state (immediately after loading the world in VRChat) and direction of rotation.
